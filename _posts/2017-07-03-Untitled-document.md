    <td>Well I started off by doing lot's of sections working through them all, and if I got stuck firstly I would re-read what I done for silly mistakes. Then if it wasn’t a silly mistake then I would re-read the instructions, if that didn’t work I would try to think logically, then I would ask my friend next to me or the teacher. For my github I thought I could improve it even more, so I took a completely different route and changed the background and the colour of the text.</td>

    <td>Some pictures didn’t work, sometimes I forgot the colon at the end of the thing i was writing and silly mistakes like that, or even sometimes I would get it completely wrong. So I need to get it right first time. </td>
