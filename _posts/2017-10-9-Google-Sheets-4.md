In today's lesson we did more work on Google Sheets. We made sure all of our discount codes were working. Then we learnt some new coding, which let's us add our Google Sheets to the bottom of our blog. So we had to do that for homework and then hand our blogs in at the end. Next lesson I think your teacher will be looking at our blogs.
