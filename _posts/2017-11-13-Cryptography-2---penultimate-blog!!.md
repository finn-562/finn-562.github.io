In today's lesson we were doing more work on the Caesar Cipher, which I talked about last time. Last week we worked on the basics and now we are trying to see if we can type in anything and it would work however it is proving difficult. In today’s lesson I did most of it and had to finish off the last bit for homework, because I made it work for a 13 letter sentence or phrase when it needs to work for any amount of letters. For my homework I did a full amount of 25 letters per phrase. It works for most small phrases and long phrases too. Hopefully next lesson I polish off anything else, which isn’t perfect and then that should be the end. Sadly this is my second last lesson of IT, possibly forever. So this is actually my penultimate blog.
