Today was the first lesson back from half term and we started a new topic. This half term's topic is Cryptography. Cryptography is 'the science or study of the techniques of secret writing, especially code and cipher systems, methods, and the like.' - Dictionary.com. So basically it is secret writing like codes. We are doing this on Google Sheets again because of the Vlookup command, which is very useful when you have a key and you need to decipher the key. This is because Vlookup can look for the certain letter in the key and translate it into the original letter. We started of using the Caesar Cipher or the shift Cipher. This is where you choose a letter instead of the original letter. It is normally in alphabetical order: if A = M, B=N, C=O etc. It was named Caesar Cipher because Caesar changed it to the letter after the original letter (if A=B, B=C, C=D etc) so the messengers couldnâ€™t read what it said or if anyone else had seen it. It is called Shift Cipher because it technically shifts one along or two along etc. So in the lesson we had to make a 5 letter word and cipher it and then decipher it back to the original again.
