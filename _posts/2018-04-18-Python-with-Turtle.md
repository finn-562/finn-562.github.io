In the last few weeks we have been programming a virtual turtle movement. This means wherever the turtle goes he will leave a mark, so you can draw shapes and different things with him. We had the challenge to write or name using turtle: at first we did it in 1D then we did it in 2D. In 2D we could fill this in with a colour. Lastly we were set with the most difficult task of writing our names in 3D, which most people didn't finish and neither did I.

Now we've moved on to creating a conversation with the computer. In this conversation the computer will ask a question, which you have programmed, then you answer it and the computer should have a normal response, which you also programmed. So the difficulty in the project set is you have to keep the interesting but you have to make normal responses. You also have to programme every response that could crop up as otherwise the computer will malfunction or just say the wrong response.
