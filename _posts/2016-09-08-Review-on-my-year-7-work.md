I think in year 7 I made a good first impression! In such things such as scratch and microbit, the simple programming was easy, but when it came to the harder programming such as pac-man and designing our own games I struggled on a bit, however in the end I completed both projects. In Prezi I found it enjoyable and quite easy as well, although I still could have improved in some areas in it.

My target for year 8 is to keep up the hard work, but re-set my target higher.
