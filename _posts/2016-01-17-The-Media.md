In my IT lesson this week, we looked at the media. Firstly we had a discussion on what media is and how it affects our everyday life. We then went on to play a game of bingo with a media twist. The questions were like: This person uses social media every day or this person has read a book this month, the rest of the rule were the same. After that we looked at an advert on a car. We had to look at this and tried to notice the sub-speech as well as the speech. We looked to see whether it was realistic or not. Finally we got set homework and we had to choose our own advert and look into it with more detail.
