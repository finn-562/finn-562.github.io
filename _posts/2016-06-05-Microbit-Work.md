Microbit Work

In the half term we got to play around with microbit. I talked about microbit and how it works last blog, but I will go into more detail today.

Microbit is used for children to practise their computer programing, it has different tutorials and a cookbook for how it works. In the cookbook it has recipes, which are the tutorials, so if you go on microbit you can find the recipes or tutorials. There are 6 different tutorials and I will show you 2 of them.

Roll the dice

Roll the dice is where you simply get the microbit to choose a random number from 1 to 6 and draw the pattern from 1 to 6 of how it would look like on a dice.

Mood Swing

Mood Swing is where you program the microbit to be happy , sad or neutral by the way that it is facing.
