In these recent lessons we have been looking at microbit and javascripts. We have done some different tutorials on different things such as making the microbit pick a random number or make the microbit happy or sad depending on which way it is facing.

There are different stages in the tutorial such as the easy stage where it tells you what to do, how to do it and where it is to the harder section where it is just plain code. We tried all of these different sections, but started on the easy section. 

We now know a lot more about writing a computer script.
