In today's lesson we did more work on Google Sheets. In the lesson we did a lot of work on the if statements: if, else if and else. We used those to get discounts on different things so we used: if you get a you get x% off, if you get b you get y% off, if you get c you get z% off and if it is none you get 0% off. Today’s lesson was good because same as last time, I’m getting all of the work done, I’m understanding it and I could probably use these skills in a job I do. For homework we used vlookup again, which for me is the most useful command out of all the one’s we have learned so far. Although I still struggle on it a bit, I ended up doing it fine. Hopefully next week’s will be as successful as all the rest of them so far and i learn more useful commands.
