Today in IT we started the new topic of Google Sheets. Mr Keen showed us how to add, times and find the average of numbers a lot quicker by using Google Sheets. We were simply trying and learning different things. For homework we were asked to try another thing on Google sheets called 'vlookup'. I struggled on this, however in the end I got it done. I think this topic is going to be very useful for the future and I will most probably use it in a job that I do. Next lesson I will learn more about spreadsheets and hopefully become better skilled.
