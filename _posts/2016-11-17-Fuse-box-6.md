    <td>I learnt by me reading out what my partner had to write and then we both looked about why it did that thing. My partner typed quicker with me saying what to write to him. It also helped knowing what was happening in the programming, because when we got stuck we simply worked it out easier.</td>

    <td>At the start when we set the fuze up, it was zoomed in close and we couldn't change it back. So we spent a while fiddling with the monitor, when it was actually the fuze that was making it zoomed in. That meant 10 minutes less of programming.

    <td>Thinking more logically and not panicking as soon as I have a problem. Next time we will set the fuze up properly, with no delay. We will also work out our problems quicker and not waste time</td>
