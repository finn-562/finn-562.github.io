For this IT lesson's homework we had to create a idendity map like what you show you are on social media. I put in how many people I have in my family, where I come from, what social media I use, my hobbies and what I want to be when I’m older.

After that we displayed it with our class I the only thing I felt worried about was if they judged me for hanging out with my family more than my friends, but nobody said anything bad about it. I also had to comment on people's identity maps, I didn’t want to be rude so I wrote contructive critisism, although most of them were very good. We commented anomenously, I felt this is good and bad. It is good because you don’t look at your friends comments, but it is bad because you want to know who wrote the bad things about you.

When I came back to see my comments I was supprised no-one judged me for being a family guy. I wasn't supprised at all to see a lot of people writing things about my football team. I guess this is different from commenting on social media because I had to think about what my hobbies are, but if I found something cool I would post that on Instagram, sometimes without thinking about it.

The idendity map showed me that I should post more about somethings like my family rather than fottball as they are more important to me. All of the six lessons helped me using social media because I now know I shouldn't always be on Instagram and I should post more things that are important to me rather than the cool things I randomly find. I will definetly take all of this into mind when I’m on Social media in the futre.
