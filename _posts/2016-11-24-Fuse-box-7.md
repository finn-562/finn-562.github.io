(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>We all tried to put all the components into the right spaces. If it didn't work we would all try to think how to fix the problem logically. It just took a while of messing about with it, until it started working for us.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>All of the components are very fiddly, so it is very difficult to work with. Also the picture, which shows where the components go, is quite hard to see. That took us quite a long time.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Put the components in quickly because we know where they go now. Then we might get more done. </td>
