In today's IT lesson we restarted our blog, so first could I apologise if some of my work is in the wrong order. He set out some rules that apply for posting blogs.

Rules that my teacher set out:

* My blog post is suppose to be about what we have learned something in the lesson, it isn't just I came in and went on a computer, it should be what we learnt, what things we used and what are target will be for next week.

* We have to fix things ourselves not asking people as a first option.

* Blog post every week.

I will try follow these rules. Also because we restarted the blog post you will see that I have a different avatar and different background colours.
