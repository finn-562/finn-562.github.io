Internet Security Threats

Peripherals is the input, output and the storage of a computer. Your inputs is your mouse and your keyboard and your webcam. Your outputs is your screen, your printer and your speakers. Your storage is your hard drive.

Viruses is a type of malware, which is short for malicious software, which is things like viruses and worms that get into your computer and embeds itself into your programs. The virus can do multiple things to ruin your device such as slow it down or if it is really bad you lose all your programs, documents and apps. If your computer or phone has a virus, it will probably make more viruses soon, so you have to stop it soon.

A trojan makes you think that it is a nice safe program, so it makes you think that you are downloading something fine, but really it attacks your computer or phone. The trojans got it name from the story about a greek army wheeling a wooden horse in, so the enemy would think it is a nice and safe present when really it had a greek army inside, just like the computer malware trojan.

Worms are more sneaky than the other malwares because the worm can spread from one computer to another computer without attaching itself to the program. Worms make themselves over and over again, so it is easier and quicker to break your computer. A worm can even spawn itself onto your email and then send itself to all of your contacts.

Spyware ,which is short for spy software, that spawns itself onto computer and phones and then takes your personal information, like your phone number, your address, your passwords, your bank account and other important information. Spyware does something called keylogging, which is basically watching what the person types. Some spyware can even use your webcam without you knowing.

Malware normally spreads from copying itself onto email and just simply duplicating itself and putting itself on different documents.
