In today's lesson we did more work on Google Sheets and what we did is half of the class didn't get onto the Discount codes for homework, but I did. The other half worked errors in the code, so for example if the shopper only wanted 4 items instead of 5 then normally it would come up with 'N/A’, however you can program it to say £0.00, so it doesn’t interfere with the total price. If it was ‘N/A’ the person couldn’t buy the 4 items they would have to pay for 5 even if they didn’t want to. So overall this is a very useful skill when it comes to Sheets and especially if you want to open a retail company. Hopefully next lesson I keep up with the work and I understand more of the useful skills that I will use in the future.
