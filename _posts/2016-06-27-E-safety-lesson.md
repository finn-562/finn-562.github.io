In today's IT lesson we looked at e-safety and more specifically on what we are scared of online. There were things such as stalkers and paedophiles, which we then looked into in more detail and we had a talk about what makes a stalker a stalker. A stalker is a stranger that has a bad intention to do something with your personal information and that is the same with paedophiles. We also looked at what the stalkers and paedophiles final outcome want to be, which we found out to be making you send inappropriate images, so they can then blackmail you. 

My target for next week will be to try hard in whatever I do as I do not know what I will be doing next week.
