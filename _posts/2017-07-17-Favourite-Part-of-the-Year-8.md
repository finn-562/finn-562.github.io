Favourite Part of the Year 8

Year 8 has been a good year in IT, my programming has improved massively. I now think I am capable of programming a website of my own. I have carried own with my Github website, I think playing around with Github is really what I will use the most in life. So for that reason I am going to say my favourite part of IT is github. I have had some highs and lows with github, it broke a few times, but then I fixed it again and it is now running fine. I think it was a full success. I got to choose things independently, things like the colour and background and make sure it looks nice and also expresses me the most. Before this year started my blog wasn't fully working with only one colour as a background, now Iâ€™ve got a very creative background. So I think that is my favourite part of the year.
