In my IT lesson today we learnt how to fix errors on Github. I am now going to tell you how to do it.

* Firstly you have to go onto your repository on Github.

* Then go onto your settings and scroll down until you find something that either says, "Your site is having problems," or “your site is published.”

* If it says "your site is published," it is fine, but if it says “your site is having problems,” you need to read on to see what is the problem.

* It should say something like "you have a problem on line 12" or “you have a problem on file style.scss.”

* You then have to go to that line orn file and sort out what is not right such as forgetting the semicolon or too many spaces.

That is my guide to you just in case your github site is having problems to publish.
