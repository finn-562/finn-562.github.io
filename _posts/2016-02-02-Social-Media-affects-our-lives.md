In today's IT lesson we got split into threeâ€™s and looked at the guidelines of social media. We then watched a video on twitter. This was a long song and it sent out a strong message, it was telling us how much time we spend on our phones, there was a birthday party and everyone their was on their phones recording it. There was another one which was someone proposing to marry someone else and the guy was videoing it because he thought it would get likes.
