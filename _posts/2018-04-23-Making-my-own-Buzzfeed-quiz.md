In today's lesson we started to create our own buzzfeed quiz. In this quiz we had to create multiple questions with each answer labelled as a number. Then at the end you would add up all of your answers and find out something about yourself, well hopefully. We used Python 3 to make this quiz, which to start with was quite challenging, finding all the variables and getting used to the software, however now I'm finding it easier. By tomorrow I hope to finish the quiz and test it out on people.
