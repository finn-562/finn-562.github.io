Propaganda in recent newspapers

When it says "given priority" it is saying the foreign people are being cared for first. Implying that British people should be first and get all of the help and attention that is needed. Personally I think this is quite racist saying that foreign people don't deserve to get help as soon as us. I’m sure some foreign people would dream about having the NHS, so why don’t we let them use it as well. It is like saying there was an Englishman in a restaurant and a Polish man in a restaurant and the Polish man got served first it would have to go on the newspaper.   		

First of all I do not understand why this was on the newspaper, because all it is, is people saying we're coming to UK, to rich guy. Secondly it is interesting how they call the poor people the migrants, yet George Clooney is american and saying on his italian doorstep meaning that he is in Italy, so technically they are both migrants. Lastly I find it quite funny how the Daily Mail think this is a massive threat to our country, but if you actually look at what has happened, it is basically, poor guys go up to rich guy and says we’re coming to the UK. Scary! 	

This is a different newspaper, but it is still talking about migrants in Italy with Clooney. I still don't really know why they are putting this in the newspaper, however this did make me laugh. What it is saying is the migrants in italy are ruining our view, it is interesting how the non-migrants/homeland people do not ruin the view, it is only the migrants that ruin it. Also something that should be noticed is they are all black and look quite poor, George Clooney is a white and rich man, so this is actually quite racist because he probably thought that they were migrants because they were black.

This was my homework in this IT lesson we were just talking about how much propaganda there is in the news.
