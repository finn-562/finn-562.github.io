    <td>I learnt from our teacher, Mr Keen, he showed us the mark scheme and talked to us about different ways on how to improve our github. He talked to us about presentation, how to write in our github and how to use different technologies. I really did learn a lot from this, thanks Mr Keen.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really. It was just Mr Keen showing us some Github pages and how to improve them. Nothing limited my learning, i just sat there and listened to him teach. However I could of asked Mr Keen some questions, which have been on my mind. The question was about how to change the colour of the actual text (like this).
